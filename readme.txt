Catch-all awesomeness for a leaner, meaner WordPress site.

== Description ==

Roots Plug is the catch-all awesome WordPress plugin that cleans up default output, uses relative URLs and provides all those handy-dandy functions that we all search for around the web - in one convenient package! Based and inspired by the [Roots Theme](http://rootstheme.com) by Ben Word.

Please see the [Roots Wiki](https://github.com/retlehs/roots/wiki/Roots-functions) for a summary of what most of this plugin has included in it. This plugin does incude `.htaccess` additions/rewrites - which may sound scary, but are pretty freakin awesome!

    The .htaccess rewrites assume your theme has the following structure:
    /css for CSS
    /img for Images
    /js for Javascripts

    You may need to adjust your theme if you run into any issues with that

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `roots-plug` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can you add `feature-x`? =

Sure! I'm always open to knew ideas. Just create a new [issue](https://github.com/zslabs/roots-plug/issues) and I'll take a gander.
